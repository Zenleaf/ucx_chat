<h2>Welcome to Ucx Chat</h2>
<p>This is a development preview version of the software. So, you should expect some bugs. As well, a few of the features have not been implemented yet.
</p>
<p>This version has not been integrated with the WebRTC client yet. I'll start working on that soon.</p>
<p>I've created a bugs channel. Please use that to report issues.</p>
<h3>User Notes</h3>
<p>Checkout the slash commands for some features like creating channels, inviting someone to a channel, and lots of other stuff. Just type <b>`/`</b> to access the commands.
